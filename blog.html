                            <strong>Event Loop:</strong> We know,JavaScript is a single Threaded Language and being
                            single Threaded it's work synchronous way. But after being single Threaded it's also works
                            asynchronous way with the help of Browser and Event Loop. <br> <br>

                            <strong>Event Loop Work:</strong> Event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to
                            perform
                            non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start
                            running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks
                            that need to be performed. <br><br>

                            <strong>As example: </strong> We asume that we take 3 variable and console them one by one.
                            Variable 3 are like: <br><br>
                            const first= 10; <br>
                            const second = 20;<br>
                            const third= 30;<br> <br>

                            console.log(first); <br><br>

                            setTimeout(() => { <br>
                            console.log(second); <br>
                            },500); <br><br>

                            console.log(third);<br> <br>

                            Here, If we run the code then we will see that in the console will be print like below:
                            <br><br>
                            console: <br>
                            10 <br>
                            30 <br>
                            20 <br> <br>

                            So, why 30 is printed or console before 20 ? That's the question right ? <br>
                            when we set
                            setTimeout() function for the second variable then it's being synchronous to asynchronous.
                            we know javaScript first check the heap or memory allowcation data synchronous or not when
                            it's goes to stack and if it's synchronous then print or console it. <br><br>
                            if it's asynchronous then it's not console. next synchronous data will be console. with
                            the help of Browser API like (DOM, AJax
                            etc) asynchronous data will be work and browser send them callback queue and the event loop
                            check stack is empty or not. if all synchronous work done and stack is empty then with the
                            help of event loop from callback queue to stack data will transfar and then the data will
                            console.

                            <strong>1)</strong>
                            Variable that is not initialized will give undefined. <br>
                            <strong>2)</strong>
                            Function with no return will give undefined. <br>
                            <strong>3)</strong>
                            Parameter that is not passed will be undefined. <br>
                            <strong>4)</strong>
                            If return has nothing on the right side then will return undefined. <br>

                            Deleting an element inside an array will give undefined. <br>
