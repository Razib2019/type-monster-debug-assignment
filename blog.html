                            <strong>CSS Box Model:</strong> In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about
                            design and layout. <br> <br>
                            The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
                            of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content (height And width).<br> <br>
                            <strong>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.</strong> <br> <br>
                            <strong>Explanation of the different parts:</strong> <br> <br>
                            <strong>Content -</strong> The content of the box, where text and images appear <br>
                            <strong>Padding -</strong> Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
                            <br>
                            <strong>Border -</strong> A border that goes around the padding and content <br>
                            <strong>Margin -</strong> Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
                            <br> <br>
                            The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between
                            elements.

                            Function with no return will give undefined. <br>
                            <strong>3)</strong>
                            Parameter that is not passed will be undefined. <br>
                            <strong>4)</strong>
                            If return has nothing on the right side then will return undefined. <br>
                            <strong>5)</strong>
                            Property that doesn't exists on an object will give result undefined. <br>

                            Deleting an element inside an array will give undefined. <br>
